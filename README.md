### Electron App

I built this react-electron desktop app for an assignment.

It creates, read, and edit json data in form of tabular UI and save to filesystem.

### Getting Started with The App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run electron:serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.

It will open new electron window in development mode.


### `npm run electron:build`

Will build the react app and than package the electron app into executable.

## Executable

If app was packaged with the above command, you can run the executable in dist/win-unpacked folder.
