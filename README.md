### Electron App

I built this react-electron desktop app for an assignment.

It creates, read, and edit json data in form of tabular UI and save to filesystem.

### Getting Started with The App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run electron:serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.

It will open new electron window in development mode.

## Executable

You can also run the windows .exe executable in dist/win-unpacked folder.
